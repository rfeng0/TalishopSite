This is website for the Van Tech Talishop in progress 

Tasks to be done:
- have the popular products pull from the javascript file, and link to the catalogue
- readd gmail, find the talishop email
- scroll function on the menu page (?)
- easier modification
- extra: fix the sort system so it's not stupid

Tasks for later:
- change bear logo
- change font
- change about us image
- change nut allergy images
- change catalogue images

done:
- have the color continue up and down (maybe?)
- have the talishop title bring you to the homepage
- change catalogue color to white
- removed facebook

extra things:
- changed the menu button to be consistent
- the header now stays at the top (maybe?)
